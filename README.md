# ExperimentalModeling

Sort of economic simpop, built in the frame of experimental modeling (sort of companion modeling).

Aims to simulate Japan Urban Growth 1950 -> present. Focuses on economic structure to try to endogoneise the stylized fact of the secondary->tertiary transition (or more precisely its effects on city system structure)

Model structure/construction inspired (in its formulation/'meta-structure', ideas and intuitions coming from thematicians) from :
 - series of Simpop Models [Pumain, 2012]
 - Marius [Cottineau, 2015]
