\section{Description of the model}


\paragraph{Ontology} We propose an agent-based model in which basic agents are cities, and their interactions causes the emergent behavior of the city system. Because of the thematic aim of the model, the following variables qualify cities :
\begin{itemize}
\item population $P(t)$
\item economic production of secondary sector $E_2(t)$
\item economic production of tertiary sector $E_3(t)$
\end{itemize}
